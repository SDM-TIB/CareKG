# Causal Relationship over Knowledge Graphs (CareKG)
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jason-huanghao/PicGoBed/master/imgs/20221017145542.png)

CareKG is a python library support causal queries over KG with abilities to using metadata from KG. 
The proposal of CareKG is published in ```css the Proceedings of 31st ACM CIKM (2022)```.
The **paper** and **video** can be found [here](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3511808.3557818).
The **slides** of CareKG presented in CIKM (2022) can be found [here](https://github.com/SDM-TIB/CareKG/blob/master/docs/CIKM2022_CareKG.pdf).

The python library is going to be ready, but you can use it now using our rource code. Examples can be found in [exp](https://github.com/SDM-TIB/CareKG/tree/master/exp).
Just provide the endpoint of your KG (e.g. by graphDB), you can play causal queries over your KG!

If you want to enable causal queries in your knowledge graph, feel free to contact me (Hao Huang) by Hao.Huang@tib.eu. 
If you want to build a KG from data in any other resources (relational database, csv files, json files, ect.), our team [Scientific Data Mangement Group](https://www.tib.eu/en/research-development/research-groups-and-labs/scientific-data-management/staff) have the whole pipeline to create KG from scratch. Please feel free to contact Prof. Dr. Maria-Esther Vidal by Maria.vidal@tib.eu.
